Alternative UOM Code/ID and Size Code auto-increment after clearing the field and clicking outside the field,BQ-368,457881,Defect,in Processing,BQ,BZMS QA ,business,sysadmin,,,Medium,,anssharma-c,ybaba-c,ybaba-c,16/Dec/25 6:12 AM,21/Dec/25 10:06 AM,22/Dec/25 7:48 PM,,22/Dec/25 12:00 AM,BZMS_BE,,"+*Description:*+
In the Amend/Freeze Master UOM screen, when a user clears the value in the Alternative UOM Code/ID field or the Size code field (using Backspace/Delete) and then clicks outside the field, the ID/Code increments by one automatically. This happens each time the user erases and clicks outside, leading to unintended auto-incrementing codes.
Observed in sections:
•    Alternate UOM details → Alternative UOM Code/ID
•    Applicable sizes → Size code


+*Steps to reproduce:*+
1.    Login to the BZMS Portal (backend officer portal) as BZ Registration Officer
2.    Select Amend Master UOM option to navigate to Amend screen.
3.    Scroll to Alternate UOM details. 
4.    In Alternative UOM Code/ID field: 
•    Remove the existing value completely using Backspace/Delete.
•    Click anywhere outside the field.
•    Observe that the value changes to an incremented ID.
•    Repeat the same steps for the Size code field in Applicable sizes section.
•    Repeat multiple times—each time the code increments by one.

+*Actual result:*+

After clearing the field and clicking outside, the Alternative UOM Code/ID and Size code fields auto-populate with an incremented value (e.g., from SUOM-40 to SUOM-41)
